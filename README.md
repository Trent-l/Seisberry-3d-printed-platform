A simple 3d-printed platform for the [Seisberry](https://github.com/erellaz/seisberry) rPi based seismometer.

Printed on a Prusa i3 mk3s+ out of PETG for less warpage of the base. This version was intended to mounted onto an existing round aluminum plate but it could be mounted to something else or feet added to the underside of the print.
Print settings were 3 layers top and bottom, 3 layer walls, and 20% infill.

The standoffs were machined out of brass but could be 3d printed instead. The lower spacers are 0.1875" long (4.5mm) and the upper spacers 0.65" (16.5mm). The screws and nuts are 4-40 or M3.

The horizontal sensor mounts have channels to allow a ziptie or string to be fed through to secure the geophone. The vertical mount is flexible and tightens up with another ziptie or piece of string.
