A simple 3d-printed platform for the [Seisberry](https://github.com/erellaz/seisberry) rPi based seismometer.

Printed on a Prusa i3 mk3s+ out of PETG for less warpage of the base. This version was intended to mounted onto an existing round aluminum plate but it could be mounted to something else or feet added to the underside of the print.
Print settings were 3 layers top and bottom, 3 layer walls, and 20% infill.
